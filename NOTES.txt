RELATING TO EDGE CASES
It seems that if multiple events are assigned to a single incident number, then
the other categories will be coalaesced onto their own lines (i.e. what the crime
was, dates, etc.), which are deliminated by newlines. There is a good possibility
that these are in order and therefore, could simply be parsed out. A good indication
of this edge case is if the incident id number is repeated, where n incident numbers
are deliminated by \n and also indicate the number of events with the same incident
number.
